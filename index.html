        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Yat Long Chan and I was born in China and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. I attended Stuyvesant High School in Lower Manhattan. 
           I enjoy reading books and I've recently reread <i>The Things They Carried</i> by Tim O'Brien.
           Some of my other hobbies include tabletop roleplaying games and (mostly watching) soccer.</p>
